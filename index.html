        Pakistan’s water originates from a number of sources. Around 60 percent of our total rainwater is derived from the monsoon rains, but a significant proportion also comes from the winter rainfall. In addition, Pakistan has a lot of glaciers which feed the river system in Pakistan. River Indus and its tributaries provide most of the water needed for irrigation. Glacial melt off has been affected due to climate change, increasing risks of flooding.

          <p>The needs of mankind account for $1.5 billion according to official figures. There must be enough water in Western Europe, because all the water from the Atlantic comes to it from the North. The ecological importance of Europe is enormous.  The emergence of large numbers of refugees in Europe is not the cause of its catastrophic fall, but the consequence of a series of international environmental events which have made a huge impression on Europe.</p></div>

          <h1>Statistics</h1>
          <p><b>Info:</b> One-third of the world's oil reserves and a significant amount of gas are concentrated on its territory, its production and transportation are growing, and its solvency is maintained. It is one of the largest countries in the world. Its natural resources are represented by forests, deserts, and diverse ecosystems. Very important natural resources are the Gulf of Finland and Russia. Over 100 million children are born in Europe each year. In the same time an ecological catastrophe threatens about 20-30 million people in one week, and this development is not only characteristic for Europe, but for the greater part of Europe. First of all it is caused by a sharp cold snap and a low standard of living in Europe.</p></div>
